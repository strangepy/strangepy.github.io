<h1>Why the Name?</h1>
<p>strangePy may seem like a bit of an unusual name choice. If you were wondering about that, there is a pretty simple explanation! I love using the editor <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> and I think it has a wonderful, whimsical name. Since I am a particle physicist at heart, the companion quark to "charm" is called "strange". Hence, my love for particle physics and my enjoyment of Python (both as a programming language and as a comedy troupe) were combined into the name "strangePy"!</p>
