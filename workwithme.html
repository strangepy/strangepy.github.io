<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Currently working remotely at a small web performance startup. I wear many hats here! Previously worked in finance and healthcare (I even passed the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/cepi/"  target="_blank">Certified Equity Professional</a> exam from the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/"  target="_blank">Leavey School of Business</a> and am passionate about personal finance).</p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Obtained a B.S. in Physics in three years from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">University of Arizona</a>. If you're looking for an icebreaker, ask me about <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model" target="_blank" >particle physics!</a></p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-code about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> I enjoy writing code to automate daily tasks and developing new skills to work more efficiently. Web scraping using a combination of the <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> bindings for <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> along with plain old <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> is an excellent way to accomplish this. For large data sets, I often prefer building my own queries in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp" target="_blank">SQL</a>.</p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-bolt about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Spent two years working in the <a href="https://ams.arizona.edu/" target="_blank">Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory</a> to design and fabricate an improved particle detector. Once, I accidentally created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen" target="_blank">liquid oxygen</a> (also known as rocket fuel) in the lab and a section of the equipment exploded. (This is exactly why I am not a chemist!)</p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-heart about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Completely in love with outdoor activities. Kayaking, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, bicycling, distance running, camping, whitewater rafting, and hiking are a few of my favourite hobbies. When the weather does not accommodate outdoor adventures, I may also play a whole host of board games and video games, as well as weekly D&D. </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-globe about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Grew up in Virginia and moved to Arizona for college, despite not knowing a single person West of the Mississippi River. These kinds of uncomfortable experiences and life changes were the key to my personal growth and development, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I have visited <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/visited_states/#US-AL,US-AR,US-AZ,US-CA,US-CO,US-DC,US-DE,US-FL,US-GA,US-ID,US-IL,US-KS,US-KY,US-MD,US-MI,US-MO,US-MT,US-NC,US-NH,US-NJ,US-NM,US-NV,US-NY,US-OH,US-OK,US-PA,US-RI,US-SC,US-TN,US-TX,US-UT,US-VA,US-VT,US-WV" target="_blank">33 states</a> in the U.S., and absolutely love cross-country road trips. </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-book about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> If you're interested in my work, you can scan through my latest blog posts or <a href="mailto:strangepy@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me directly</a> with the word "Resume" in the subject line for a (possibly outdated) copy of my resume. Working with startups means that sometimes my skills develop faster than I can update my resume! </p>

<h1>Why the Name?</h1>
<p>strangePy may seem like a bit of an unusual name choice. If you were wondering about that, there is a pretty simple explanation! I love using the editor <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" target="_blank">PyCharm</a> and I think it has a wonderful, whimsical name. Since I am a particle physicist at heart, the companion quark to "charm" is called "strange". Hence, my love for particle physics and my enjoyment of Python (both as a programming language and as a comedy troupe) were combined into the name "strangePy"!</p>
