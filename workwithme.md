# About Me

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Currently working remotely at a small web performance startup. I wear many hats here! Previously worked in finance and healthcare (I even passed the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/cepi/" >Certified Equity Professional</a> exam from the Leavey School of Business and am passionate about personal finance).</p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Obtained a B.S. in Physics in three years from the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a>. If you're looking for an icebreaker, ask me about particle physics! </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-code about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> I enjoy writing code to automate daily tasks and developing new skills to work more efficiently. Web scraping using a combination of the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> bindings for <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a> along with plain old <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> is an excellent way to accomplish this. </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-bolt about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Spent two years working in the <a href="https://ams.arizona.edu/">Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory</a> to design and fabricate an improved particle detector. Once, I accidentally created liquid oxygen, aka rocket fuel, in the lab and exploded a section of the equipment. (This is exactly why I am not a chemist!)</p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-heart about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Completely addicted to outdoor activities. Kayaking, rock climbing, ultimate frisbee, bicycling, distance running, camping, whitewater rafting, and hiking are a few of my many hobbies. When the weather does not accommodate outdoor adventures, I am also known to play a whole host of board games and online video games, as well as weekly D&D. </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-globe about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span> Grew up in Virginia and moved out to Arizona for college, despite not knowing a single person west of the Mississippi River. Uncomfortable experiences and life changes are oftentimes the key to personal growth and development, and I welcome those opportunities. I have visited 33 of the states in America, and absolutely love cross country road trips. </p>

<p class="about-text"><span class="fa fa-book about-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>If you're interested in my work, you can pull up my latest blog posts for a category or project. You can also <a href="mailto:strangepy@gmail.com">contact me</a> with the word "Resume" in the subject line or a (possibly outdated) copy of my resume. Working with startups means that sometimes my skills develop faster than I can update my resume! </p>

# Why the Name? 
strangePy may seem like a bit of an unusual name choice. If you were wondering about that, there is a pretty simple explanation! I love using the editor PyCharm and I think it has a wonderful, whimsical name. Since I am a particle physicist at heart, the companion quark to "charm" is called "strange". Hence, my love for particle physics and my enjoyment of Python (both as a programming language and as a comedy troupe) were combined into the name "strangePy"!
