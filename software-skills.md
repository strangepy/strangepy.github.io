This page essentially assembles some examples of projects that I have worked on for each language or software system. There are plenty of other services that I am familiar with, but may not be included in this list, so please contact me for the most recent information. 

As you may be able to tell from the list below, I have some familiarity with multiple languages and software systems. Since I have worked for a couple of startup software-as-a-service companies, I have been able to wear many hats and learn quite quickly. 

# Languages 

## C 
My first introduction to writing code was in C as part of a Computational Physics course. During my entire college studies, there were prompts to solve physics problems computationally, so many of my first coding projects involved: 
- Plotting the interaction of light near a black hole 
- Writing functions for Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion 
- Analyzing and estimating error inherent in computational methods, such as roundoff error 
- Removing dimensions from equations before writing any code
All of this code was written using PuTTY to SSH into a Unix server. From there, we would open pico (or later emacs) from the command line, write the code, close pico, compile the code, and then run the .c file directly from the command line. 

## JavaScript 
For the past three years, I have worked on a number of projects in JavaScript. At first, I learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to populate legal agreements for users to accept their stock and option grants in an online system. Since then, I have used JavaScript exensively for automated testing (in selenium and Katalon) and for customzing data collection by an analytics JavaScript tag. I am quite familiar with navigating the DOM using JavaScript, as well as interacting with a variety of web forms written in Angular, Material, or other frameworks. I have used JavaScript daily for over three years. 

## Python
As someone who loves working with data, Python is an amazing programming language. For the past few years, I have been able to write some internal tools and selenium scripts using Python. The internal tools are often built to automate a particular task or data pull that is not available via an API. I also use Python to make API requests and then compile the data into a custom report for clients. 

## HTML & CSS 
I learned HTML & CSS to format legal documents for users to accept within a client's online portal. For over two years, I have worked in a consulting capacity to analyze a client's website for potential improvements to load order and browser-side rendering of HTML and CSS files. I also have spent hundreds of hours writing selenium scripts that interact with the HTML document. 

## LaTeX
For those of you nto familiar with LaTeX, it is a free software project for typesetting and text markup. I used it during my entire time at college to format laboratory papers in the same manner as the scientific journals. I used it weekly during my college studies and it makes writing physics equations in a paper almost trivially easy. If you have ever tried to write an equation in Microsoft Word using subscript and superscript, you should understand what I mean. 

## SQL
I have 3+ years of experience heavily using SQL. Originally, I learned SQL at home so I could help a coworker with their Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) responsibilities. That work included receiving a .dat file from a deprecated software system, and then running a variety of scripts to validate the data against a series of logical tests. Any failed checks (such as a stock being sold before it was purchased) would be manually resolved with the client and updated in the local database. Once the data had been verified and passed a final set of checks (all written in SQL), then the data would be carefully processed into the full database system. 

I love pulling data from databases directly, and the process of scrubbing data before it is imported into a new system. Data validity is extremely important to me, and I have extensive experience with troubleshooting logical inconsistencies in database tables. For the past two years, I gained experience working with big data sets and ensuring queries will not be too taxing on the infrastructure. My knowledge also includes pulling customized data sets using inner selects, joins, and proper filtering with WHERE and HAVING clauses. 

# Services & Tools

## jMeter
Every week for the past year (and counting), I run a custom jMeter crawl to open a pre-defined list of URLs and check each page against a list of banned terms. The output is separated into lists of inaccessible URLs (typically 400-level HTTP codes), URLs with page errors (the input data did not return proper results), and URLs with banned terms (including which banned terms were found and a custom code). 

I also have an upcoming project to crawl a website for a list of URLs that later becomes the input of a selenium test. 

## Code Versioning
I am familiar with multiple code versioning tools including, but not limited to: 
- Git & GitHub
- SVN
- Mercurial

## Linux
At home, a Linux distro is actually on nearly all of my devices. I most frequently use Ubuntu, but have tested out a few other distros for specific use cases. 

# Unix
As mentioned in the section for the C programming language, I have used Unix systems both in college studies and at an accelerator laboratory. 

## Excel
Sometimes, Excel is the tool of choice for a particular client or task. I can use vlookups, pivot tables, and have even written a few macros. I am often the person people come to when they need help doing something in Excel quickly. I have also helped clients automate certain Excel tasks such as: 
* Formatting the output data of a JMeter crawl 
* Running API requests and combining the results into tables 
* Calculating pricing for an entire Saas platform

## Selenium
Nearly all of my experience with selenium is in Python or in software systems built to run a specific set of selenium commands. Selenium is essential for automated web testing, and I have multiple years of experience working in it. I have spent hundreds of hours writing and troubleshooting selenium scripts. 

## Katalon
I have used both the Katalon Chrome extension and the full Katalon Studio. One client only supported the Katalon Chrome extension, so I have a lot of experience working with it. I have used Katalon Studio for a few projects so far, and it has so much more functionality than the Chrome extension. 

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
I have tested out a variety of IDEs and am open to using pretty much any IDE if it is best for a particular language. Here is a short list, in no particular order, to give you an idea:
- PyCharm
- Atom
- Jupyter Notebook
- Brackets
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- emacs
- Notepad++
- pico 

## Snowflake
As a data analyst at a previous company, I used Snowflake nearly every day for two years to run queries on big data tables for custom reports and troubleshooting. 

## Postman
Postman is an essential tool for the consumption of API endpoints. It is quick to set up and easy to use, with a lot of additional functionality. Postman is used almost daily and I have been working with it for a few years now. 

## VirtualBox
This has primarily been used for at-home projects, especially running a Linux flavor within a Windows desktop. VirtualBox is extremely useful and I found it easy to set up and use.
