title: Overview of Software Services and Languages
---

This page essentially assembles some examples of projects that I have worked on for each language or software system. There are plenty of other services that I am familiar with, but may not be included in this list, so please contact me for the most recent information. 

# Languages 

## C 
My first introduction to writing code was in C as part of a Computational Physics course. During my entire college studies, there were prompts to solve physics problems computationally, so many of my first coding projects involved: 
- Plotting the interaction of light near a black hole 
- Writing functions for Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion 
- Analyzing and estimating error inherent in computational methods, such as roundoff error 
- Removing dimensions from equations before writing any code
All of this code was written using PuTTY to SSH into a Unix server to open pico (or later emacs) from the command line, close pico, and run the .c file directly from the command line. 

## JavaScript 
web testing, custom functions for an analytics service 

## Python 

## HTML & CSS 

## LaTeX
For those of you nto familiar with LaTeX, it is a free software project for typesetting and text markup. I used it during my entire time at college to format laboratory papers in the same manner as the 

## SQL
I have 3+ years of experience heavily using SQL. Originally, I learned SQL at home so I could help a coworker with their Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) responsibilities. That work included receiving a .dat file from a deprecated software system, and then running a variety of scripts to validate the data against a series of logical tests. Any failed checks (such as a stock being sold before it was purchased) would be manually resolved with the client and updated in the local database. Once the data had been verified and passed a final set of checks (all written in SQL), then the data would be carefully processed into the full database system. 

I love pulling data from databases directly, and the process of scrubbing data before it is imported into a new system. Data validity is extremely important to me, and I have extensive experience with troubleshooting logical inconsistencies in database tables. For the past two years, I gained experience working with big data sets and ensuring queries will not be too taxing on the infrastructure. My knowledge also includes pulling customized data sets using inner selects, joins, and proper filtering with WHERE and HAVING clauses. 

# Services & Tools

## jMeter
Every week for the past year (and counting), I run a custom jMeter crawl to open a pre-defined list of URLs and check each page against a list of banned terms. The output is separated into lists of inaccessible URLs (typically 400-level HTTP codes), URLs with page errors (the input data did not return proper results), and URLs with banned terms (including which banned terms were found and a custom code). 

I also have an upcoming project to crawl a website for a list of URLs that later becomes the input of a selenium test. 

## Code Versioning
I am familiar with multiple code versioning tools including, but not limited to: 
- Git & GitHub
- SVN
- Mercurial

## Linux & Unix

## Excel

## Selenium
Nearly all of my experience with selenium is in Python or in software systems built to run a specific set of selenium commands. Selenium is essential for automated web testing, and I have a few years of experience working in it. 

## Katalon
I have used both the Katalon Chrome extension and the full Katalon Studio. One client only supported the Katalon Chrome extension, so I have a lot of experience working with it. I have used Katalon Studio for a few projects so far, and it has so much more functionality than the Chrome extension. 

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
I have tested out a variety of IDEs and am open to using pretty much any IDE if it is best for a particular language. Here is a short list, in no particular order, to give you an idea:
- PyCharm
- Atom
- Jupyter Notebook
- Brackets
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- emacs
- Notepad++
- pico 

## Snowflake
As a data analyst at a previous company, I used Snowflake nearly every day for two years to run queries on big data tables for custom reports and troubleshooting. 

## Postman
Postman is an essential tool for the consumption of API endpoints. It is quick to set up and easy to use, with a lot of additional functionality. Postman is used almost daily and I have been working with it for a few years now. 

## VirtualBox
This has primarily been used for at-home projects, especially running a Linux flavor within a Windows desktop. VirtualBox is extremely useful and I found it easy to set up and use.
